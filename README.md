# My-Transit

Introduction 
I created this site to Make transit easier to understand in San Francisco users have access to bus routes and their schedules along with the latest updates from SFMTA about re-routes downed lines etc.


Future additions. 
I would like users to be able to save which routes they take most and be able to save it to their user profile so the bus times for those routes pop up first. i would also like to do more styling and make it more visually appealing. 

Technologies used:
Django, Django Rest Framework, CSS, JS
